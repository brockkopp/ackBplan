\section{Risk Analysis}

Seasoned entrepreneurs and investors know that things rarely unfold as planned.
Investors want to understand the risks, and that you have thought about those risks
and have a plan to address them should they occur.

Think about the critical success factors for the business. Critical success factors
(CSFs) are statements that identify what must be done to overcome challenges or
maximize the opportunities identified in the business plan. The CSFs should answer
the question, “What must we do to be successful?” List three to four CSFs for your
business.

Use a simple table that outlines the key risks that could detract the business from
achieving the plan. Think about the five to ten key risks to the business and what
you will do to mitigate each risk.

Risk Table

Record the critical success factors (CSFs) for your business in the
corresponding section of the Business Plan and Executive Summary
workbook template.

Complete the risk template that is included in the Business Plan and
Executive Summary workbook template.
