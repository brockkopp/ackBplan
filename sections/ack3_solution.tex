Acknowledgements is a web-based document tracking platform, facilitating secure sharing and approval of technical documents. In a world where liability is paramount, having a clear record of a document’s evolution is critical for assuring the safety and integrity of the end product. A simple web interface will allow for systematic approval of a document. The system will allow for collaboration within an organization as well as with external partners, any of whom can sign off on a document throughout its lifecycle.

Acknowledegements differentiates itself from existing solutions by empahsizing simplicity and ease of use. Most solutions on the market are made in-house by companies and are rarely complete, effective or user-friendly. Significant improvements have been made in web application technologies and Ackwnowledgements will leverage these technologies to simplify the user's experience. User acceptance has been identified as a significant challenge to be overcome by Acknowledgements, and as such a new user must realize the advantages of using Acknowledgements quickly before them become discouraged.

\subsection{Development Timeline}
Acknowledgement will primarily be a document management application with the ability to automate document distribution between many parties. This core functionality will be complemented by enhanced security which will allow users to “approve” documents, while maintaining all industry legal accountability requirements.

The initial release of the product will only contain this core functionality. However each company will have new and unique requirements for Acknowledgements given their specific situation. These additional features (or ``modules'') will be developed for the company for an additional charge. Once each additional module has been developed, it will also be avaliable to other clients, again for an additional charge. As such the capabilities of Acknowledgements will grow with industry requirements.
