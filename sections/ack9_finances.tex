Initially only \$50 seed financing will be required. This will cover meanial costs associated with working from home and developing the product. This assumes our team is volunteering their hours to develop the product.

Series A financing entails purchasing the required server space to host our application for our client to access it before we have started to receive revenue. The rest of the costs associated with this stage of financing are associated with travel to and from client meetings.

Series B financing is again to cover small costs that have to do with client meetings. All necissary expansion costs are covered by the revenue obtained by initial client membership fees.

During the ongoing phase, {\bf Acknowledgements} is self-sustaining based on revenue and does not need additional financing.

\subsection{Pitch Scenarios}
Ideally, you can provide two sales scenarios
based on a high and low case to show the sensitivity and range for your plan.

\subsection{Accounting}
The {\bf Acknowledgements} Balance Sheet for the first year is presented in teh following table. This Balance Sheet does not assume that the development hours provided by the team are volunteered for free.
