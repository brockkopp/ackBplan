\section{Finances}

Cost, revenue and cash flow projections will determine the amount of funding
required. Describe plausible, value-enhancing stepping stones and tie them to the
sales plan. The business plan should drive the budget, not the other way around.

Your goal is to describe the growth rate of your business, how long it will take to
reach break-even and profitability, resources required to get there, and your funding
requirements to achieve your plan. Ideally, you can provide two sales scenarios
based on a high and low case to show the sensitivity and range for your plan.

Have your accounting professional prepare your income statement,
balance sheet and cash flow. Include them in the corresponding
section of the Business Planning and Executive Summary workbook
template.
