\section{Business Model}

Acknowledgements is a technical document management system, capable of handling the construction industry’s document approval, distribution and archival needs. Clients using {\it Acknowledgements} will benefit from greatly a simplified process of managing drawings as they are sent between multiple firms and contractors, while assuring that all revisions and associated communications are archived in case they are ever needed. Since drawings and communications will exist within Acknowledgement’s secure online repository, they can  be accessed 24/7 from anywhere in the world – whether its from a desk in Toronto or the 100th floor of Hong Kong construction site.

\subsection{Partnerships}
In the near future, {\it Acknowledgements} will seek partnerships with A Small Orange (web hosting company), LibreOffice (software development company) and Mint.com (secure web application development company). These companies each provide services which can aid the development of {\it Acknowledgements} either through providing a service or experience.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Mint.com} will be our first partnership. Security is an important part of our clients' workflow. Mint.com is experienced in creating secure applications, and they will be able to help us ensure that our application is secure.
  \item {\bf A Small Orange} will be our second partner, and will be pursued once our product is done development. All our services will be hosted on their servers. They offer great prices and great services and will be a valuable part of our business.
  \item {\bf LibreOffice} will be a long-term partner. Once our product is established with a starting client base, we will expand the offerings of our product to include a fully integrate office suite in our online software.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distribution}
The distribution of {\it Acknowledgements} is greatly simplified as a web application. The service will in general be accessible by multiple clients from a single central location. If a client would prefer to host the service on-site for security or other client-specific reasons, this will be possible however additional support costs will be charged for servicing the remote server. Assuming a client is using the centrally hosted option, the cost to {\it Acknowledgements} per additional client will be negligible during early stages of deployment. Common web hosting solutions are capable of serving hundreds of clients without the need to upgrade. As {\it Acknowledgements} grows, distribution costs will increase marginally, but be only a small percentage of the additional revenue per client.

While hosting {\it Acknowledgements} centrally will greatly reduce distribution costs, it also increases risk since there will be a single physical failure point. This risk will be mitigated by utilizing a large hosting company such as Amazon, which allows the deployment of {\it Acknowledgements} to be managed centrally, but have redundant hosting centers in case of server failure. 

\subsection{Pricing}
While {\it Acknowledgements} will become a critical system for the client, they will be initially unaware of their need. As such Acknowledgement's pricing scheme will emphasize initial low entry costs, with costs growing proportionally with the client's dependence on the application. Client revenue is proportional to the size of the company's current contracts. As such the cost of {\it Acknowledgements} will increase on a per-project basis. This scheme will be logical to a client since all drawings and other document will all be project specific.

{\it Acknowledgements} pricing will therefore be divided into three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trial} - All potential clients will be eligible for a trial of the software, free of charge. During this trial the client will have full application functionality for the scope and period of the project. The trial will allow a potential client to try the software concurrently with their established practices, thus minimizing risk while realizing the benefits of {\it Acknowledgements}.
\item \textbf{Ongoing Fees} - Upon completion of the trial, the company will be charged a fee based on the current number of projects being managed through {\it Acknowledgements}. This pricing scheme will allow companies to slowly adopt {\it Acknowledgements}, without large upfront costs. As user acceptance grows, the application will become critical to the client's business model.
\item \textbf{Extended Functionality} - The development of additional features will possible at any point after the client has become an ongoing {\it Acknowledgements} client. Additional features will be available for an upfront development cost in addition to a small ongoing yearly fee.
\end{itemize}
