\section{Marketing and Sales}
Market adoption and sales are the true measures of success. Clearly convey your strategy and tactics to penetrate the market and drive sales. Potential investors want to understand your customer awareness and buying stimulus programs from the customer’s and salesperson’s perspective. If you are not currently selling your product, explain your product launch plans. Convince the audience that you have an effective go-to-market strategy that will not break the bank.

Include the following key points:
- What is your go-to-market strategy?
- How will you drive market demand for your product?
- What is your branding strategy?
- What is your pricing strategy?
- What is your marketing communication plan?
- How will you recruit and build your sales force?
- What is your distribution plan?
- Who will be your key partners?
- What is your customer retention strategy?
- Who are your largest customers?

Refer to the information you have documented in Market Strategy Development Workbook 2: Critical Value Factors and Market Strategy Development Workbook 3: Strategic Marketing Approach.
