\section{Management Team}

This section demonstrates that you have a capable, ambitious and trustworthy
management team. You may hear investors say that they have invested in a winning
team, which they have either worked with before or who have had some prior
entrepreneurial successes. Investors will often look for a management team with the
following attributes:

- Balance: Depending on the company’s stage of development, the
management team will contain a mix of technical, sales and marketing
experience. The CEO may be the founder or may be hired later as the
company gets financing.
- Domain knowledge: Assure the investors that you know your domain deeply
at a macro- and at a micro-level.
- Experience: The management team’s biographies and CVs should highlight
the relevance of their backgrounds to the venture.
- Ambition: Demonstrate that you are aligned with the goal of capital gains.
Investors want to see a business that has the potential to scale and that you
are prepared to do what is necessary to accomplish this goal.

To read more about how to write great bios for the executive team, see the
relevant section in HR Management Workbook 1: Building an A-Team.

Investors also want to understand how you will ramp up your company as you grow and take on financing. Consider including a section that summarizes the key hires over the next 12 to 18 months. The Hiring Calendar in HR Management Building Block 1 is a great supporting tool for this section.

Write an introductory paragraph for each management team member
that captures the key points discussed in the corresponding section of
the Business Planning and Executive Summary workbook template.
Include biographies and CVs in the appendices to the business plan.
