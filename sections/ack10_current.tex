\section{Current status, use of proceeds and milestones}

\subsection{Current Status and Milestones}
We are currently in the product development stage, described in our Financing Roadmap in the Financing section. The product will be finished development by mid-August. This will constitute the ``Start'' Milestone on our Growth Cycle/Financing Roadmap.

\subsection{Funding and Use of Proceeds}
Currently, we need {\bf \$2000. }

This money will help us with the small costs associated with setting up our home office. The majority of the money will go to setting up the web servers to host our product for our first client and the meetings associated with collaborating with that first client. These funds will last us through to December 2013, when we start to work with our second client.

These funds {\bf will take us to a profitable state.}
