\section{Current status, use of proceeds and milestones}

In this section, describe how much money you need, what you will do with the funds,
how long the money will last and what value-enhancing milestone the funds provide.
If this funding does not provide you cash to profitability, then ensure that the
investors understand what value will be created in the company so that you can raise
additional financing at a higher valuation.

List your accomplishments, detailed information about how you have financed your
organization, the amount of money you would like to raise and how you plan to
use the investors’ cash. This is your implementation roadmap. You can provide this
information using the following table format.

Tables:
- Sources of Funding
- Use of Proceeds

These should align with the financial statements that you have included in the
previous section.

Provide investors with the milestones you plan to achieve with the funding and how
these milestones will increase the company’s value. A timeline is a useful visual
representation that details the milestones you will achieve and the funding required
to reach those milestones. Consider the following example:

Record the information for your company in the table provided in the
Business Plan and Executive Summary workbook template.
You will have created a timeline chart as directed in section 4 of
Business Planning and Financing Management Workbook 1: Developing
a Financing Strategy for Your Company. Retrieve the chart from
the Finance Workbook 1 workbook template and include it in the
corresponding section of the Business Plan and Executive Summary
workbook template.
